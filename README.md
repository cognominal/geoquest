## Geoquest quests, their modes and their URLs

Note: this is an informal specification. Everything has not been yet
implemented.

Geoquest can run different quests in different modes for different parts of the
world. Each quest has its own
[URL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/components-of-a-url/) that you can share.
Unrecognized parts of an URL query string are silently ignored. Thru the menu,
you can access the daily quest.

Initially you are presented with a map of the world. Hovering or clicking
allows to transitively search for a part of the world (zone) and select it for a quest. 
As you search further, the interface zooms into zones with further granularity. 

Once you have found a quest that suits you, okay it to start that specific
quest. For example you can choose Europe, then Western Europe and than German
Landers. If you zoom out, if you have not selected your quest, you get back to
a proposed quest on a larger area. You can use the menu to adjust the quest
mode. That will restart the quest. Among other things, the mode dictates the
infos that will be presented for searching the zone. That can be a combination
of name, flag or other specific informations if available for the zone choosen
for the quest.

## zone granularity

[tags.json](src/lib/assets/data/tags.json)

Questa involving different granularities should be buildable from menus.
A Caucase quest would include countries like Azerbaq√Ødjan and Armenia and
Russian federal subjects like Chechnya and Dagestan.
It may be possible to add conventions like using modifier keys to build such
a quest directly from the world map.

How colors aew generated ? Becuse it we mix different granualities, we will have conflicts.

## Saving you achievements

On a given browser, the state of your progress is maintained.
Thru the menu you can see the list of propoosed achievments.
Eventually you shoud be able to cut and paste the states from
one browser to another.

## Proposing newer quests

You can create quests for specific part of the world 
by adding and  editiong appropriate json and geogjson file.

You can share them with [pull
requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

## Developping

You can use whatever editor but [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) makes life easier.

## Developping within a browser 

You can ever edit and run geoquest from within chrome or firefox browsers using
[codespaces](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/introducing-visual-studio-codespaces/).
Doing so will use a managed [container](https://containers.dev/) and will free
you from installing anything on your computer. The safari browser currently
like features to run vscode (but it run geoquest fine).

Assuming you already have a github account. Just open [Geoquest github
repo](https://github.com/woutdp/geoquest), type '.' in the window and you get a
vscode editor on the page. Click on the button on the lower left, you get a
menu, pick "Continue working on", then pick "Create new code space". After a
few more steps you got a running container. You can have share the container
URL to team work.

## Geoquest as a vscode extension

Support of Geoquest as a vscode extension is a possibility too
that would allow to use Geoquest without Net connectivity.

## Developping

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or
`pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server. Note if you develop the
project in a container, the npm install has been done when starting the
container.

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open

# to automatically format the code
npm run format
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Contributing

The code at the moment is still a bit messy, especially the code for handling different 'game modes'. Feel free to refactor, fix or add features.

## data driven 

Currently geoquest is driven by three files relative to
src/lib/assets/ :
data/tags.json
data/countries.json
topojson/world.json


## adding geojson data

A clear definition of the expected features will help to get the data
structures right. When possible, choosing quests should be done from the
map. The exception being non connex straddling entities.

A general principle similar to web routing is to use the file
hierarchy as much as possible. We will keep the tags.json only for straddling
entities. Tools will be needed to convert existing geojson files to fit the
explicite file based hierarchy. Original geojson files will be kept in a
separate folded with mention of their origin. 


geojson data may have not enough level of hierachies. For pedagogical reasonss,
at any given level one should not have more than 10-15 children.

An administrative mode will allows to create refined hierarchies if they
are njot present in the orinal files.

world.geojson 
  world/
    world.geo.json
    world.bbox.json
    france/
       regions/
          departements/
      

Geoquest will has three modes : the select mode, the quest mode and the
admninistrative mode. Select mode is used to pick a quest. When the quest is
picked, the url is updated so that quest can be shared.


## Aministrative mode

The administrative mode is quite like the quest select mode.
It is used to create/update groups to refine the map
hierarchy to add levels create/update 

A straddling entity is an entity that contains entities of
different levels.

At any given moment an entity is current and the map displays an
entity and its immediate subentities. 
Subentities are immediate children of the current entity except
when the sqaid entity is a straddling one.
Maybe displaying the entiy is
redundant because it is the union of the subentities

## Selecting a quest on the map

The initial entity is the 
world. When the cursor has been whithin a subentity for 5 second,
the said entity becomes current and the map is zoomed in to an aread a
little bigger than the bounding box.
